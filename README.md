# SudokuSolver
A C++-based Sudoku Solver implementing three distinct approaches to solve Sudoku puzzles. This project explores various strategies for solving Sudoku, offering insights into algorithmic problem-solving and optimization techniques.
Features:

  - Three Approaches:
      1. Logical Deduction: Solves puzzles using rule-based techniques to deduce the placement of numbers.
      2. Constraint Propagation: Efficiently narrows down possibilities by propagating constraints across the grid.
      3. Hybrid Method: Combines logical deduction with advanced heuristics for complex puzzles.
  - Modular C++ implementation with clean and well-commented code.
  - Command-line interface for inputting and solving puzzles.

This repository is a great resource for C++ programmers and puzzle enthusiasts interested in exploring multiple problem-solving techniques for Sudoku.
